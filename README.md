# Country Information Service

A REST web application built in Go that provides information about countries and their historical population data.

## Overview

This service aggregates data from multiple third-party APIs to provide consolidated information about countries, including general details and population history. It's designed to demonstrate effective API integration and data transformation.

### Features
- Country general information (name, continents, population, languages, etc.)
- Historical population data with optional year range filtering
- Service status monitoring

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.23 or higher
- Internet connection (to access third-party APIs)

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd countryinfo-api
```

### Building

To compile the application:

     {"year":2012,"value":5018573},
     {"year":2013,"value":5079623},

#### 3. Service Status
```
GET /countryinfo/v1/status/
```

## Architecture

This service integrates with two external APIs:
1. CountriesNow API (http://129.241.150.113:3500/api/v0.1/)
2. REST Countries API (http://129.241.150.113:8080/v3.1/)

The service processes and transforms data from these sources to provide a unified interface for country information.

## Deployment

The service is deployed on Render at: [https://countryinfo-api.onrender.com](https://countryinfo-api.onrender.com)

## Development Notes

- Error handling follows REST best practices
- Requests to third-party APIs are made as small as possible
- The service uses only Go standard library to minimize dependencies
